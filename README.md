# Feature Flighting Management System
Feature toggles is a technique using which you can turn "on" or "off" a feature without a complete system deployment. It's a great technique for controlled feature rollout, conducting A/B tests and implementing Canary cohorts.
This is a centralized feature flighting management system which leverages Azure App Configuration's Feature Management.

## Capabilities
1. REST APIs for evaluating Feature Flags
2. Support for multi-tenancy (without additional infrastructure)
3. Ring-based feature rollout
4. REST APIs for managing feature flightings (CRUD)
5. Integration with Graph API for evaluating flags based on Groups
